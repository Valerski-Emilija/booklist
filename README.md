# Booklist
PHP application to create, display and manage a list of your favourite books.

Create a list of books which you can manage (edit, delete, add new items).

Plain PHP(7.2), no frameworks.
No fancy designs nor animations, just bootstrap CSS.

All you need to run it on your local machine is download it to your localhost (/var/www/html on linux or wherever your xampp/mamp handles your projects on windows or mac),
and create the database (look at db.sql).

navigate to http://localhost/booklist.

The startpage displays the last 6 entries in the database (if you have any) and a search form to search books by title, author or keywords.

navigate to http://localhost/booklist/admin to login (look at login.php for login password, and beware! it's only a development setup you should never use in production).

Start creating your booklist and have fun :-)
